# Crypto Payment Flow Implementation Guide

This guide details the modifications for the new, streamlined crypto payment workflow. The following files have been created with a `.new` suffix to contain the updated code. This approach ensures that the existing application functionality is not altered, and you can switch between the old and new implementations by changing the import statements in your application.

### New Files Created:

1.  **`src/services/db.new.js`**: Contains the updated database logic.
2.  **`src/components/PaymentModal.new.vue`**: The updated payment modal with the new user flow.
3.  **`src/views/admin/AdminEnrollments.new.vue`**: The updated admin page to view and confirm payments.

### How to Integrate:

To use the new functionality, you will need to update the import paths in the relevant files to point to the `.new.js` and `.new.vue` files.

### Conflict Analysis:

The changes are carefully scoped to the crypto payment process and will not conflict with other parts of the application:

-   **Other Payment Methods**: The logic for Paystack and Simulated enrollments remains completely untouched.
-   **Other Database Functions**: The changes in `db.new.js` are additive (a new function `submitPaymentConfirmation`) or modify only the crypto-specific part of an existing function (`createEnrollment`). All other database functions (`getUserProfile`, `getAllCourses`, etc.) are unaffected.
-   **Other Admin Pages**: The changes are confined to the `AdminEnrollments.new.vue` component and do not impact other admin views like `AdminUsers` or `AdminCourses`.
-   **User Authentication**: The authentication flow is not modified.

This separation ensures a safe and reversible implementation.
