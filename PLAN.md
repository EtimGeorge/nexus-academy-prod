# Detailed Plan for User Management and Dashboard Enhancements

## Introduction
This document outlines a phased approach to improve user management and dashboard statistics within the Nexus Academy platform. The goal is to ensure accurate representation of all authenticated users, provide a distinct count of enrolled users, and display enrollment status directly within the user management interface.

## Problem Statement
Currently, the admin panel's user list (`AdminUsers.vue`) and dashboard statistics (`AdminDashboard.vue`) do not accurately reflect all authenticated users in the database. Specifically:
1.  Not all authenticated users appear in the `AdminUsers.vue` list.
2.  The "Total Users" count on the `AdminDashboard.vue` is inaccurate, showing fewer users than actually exist in Firebase Authentication.
3.  There is no clear distinction or count for users who have enrolled in courses versus all authenticated users.

## Overall Goal
To provide a comprehensive and accurate overview of all authenticated users and their enrollment status within the admin panel, enhancing both user management and dashboard reporting.

---

## Phase 1: Ensure All Authenticated Users are in Firestore

### Objective
Guarantee that every user who authenticates (signs up or logs in) has a corresponding profile document in the Firestore `users` collection. This is foundational for accurate user listing and counting.

### Rationale
Firebase Authentication and Firestore are separate services. User records in Authentication do not automatically create documents in Firestore. The `createUserProfile` function is intended to bridge this gap, but its current implementation might not be robust enough to handle all authentication flows or ensure updates for existing users.

### Action: Modify `src/services/db.js` - `createUserProfile` function

We will update the `createUserProfile` function to:
*   Check if a user's profile already exists in Firestore.
*   If it's a new user, create the document with `createdAt` and a default `role` of "student".
*   If the user already exists, update relevant fields (`email`, `displayName`, `photoURL`) and set an `updatedAt` timestamp, ensuring the profile is always current.

#### Detailed Steps:

1.  **Locate `createUserProfile` in `src/services/db.js`.**
2.  **Replace the existing `createUserProfile` function with the following code block.**

    ```javascript
    export const createUserProfile = async (user) => {
      if (!user) return;
      const userRef = doc(db, "users", user.uid);
      const userSnap = await getDoc(userRef);

      if (!userSnap.exists()) {
        // Only set createdAt if the document is being created for the first time
        const userData = {
          uid: user.uid,
          email: user.email,
          displayName: user.displayName || null,
          photoURL: user.photoURL || null,
          createdAt: serverTimestamp(),
          role: "student", // Default role for new users
        };
        return setDoc(userRef, userData, { merge: true });
      } else {
        // If the user document already exists, just update relevant fields
        const updates = {
          email: user.email,
          displayName: user.displayName || null,
          photoURL: user.photoURL || null,
          updatedAt: serverTimestamp(),
        };
        return setDoc(userRef, updates, { merge: true });
      }
    };
    ```

#### Verification:
1.  **Sign up a new user** through the application's signup flow.
2.  **Check your Firestore database** under the `users` collection. A new document with the user's UID as its ID should appear, containing `createdAt` and `role: "student"`.
3.  **Log in with an existing user** (who might not have had a Firestore profile before).
4.  **Check your Firestore database** again. A new document should be created for this user if it didn't exist, or its `updatedAt` field should be updated if it did.
5.  **Verify `AdminUsers.vue`**: All authenticated users should now appear in the list.
6.  **Verify `AdminDashboard.vue`**: The "Total Users" count should now accurately reflect all authenticated users.

---

## Phase 2: Add "Enrolled Users" Count to Dashboard

### Objective
Introduce a new statistic on the admin dashboard that displays the total number of *unique users* who have enrolled in at least one course.

### Rationale
This provides a clear distinction between the total user base and the active, paying customer base, offering valuable insights into user engagement and conversion.

### Action 1: Modify `src/services/db.js` - `getAdminDashboardStats` function

We need to add logic to count unique enrolled users. Firestore's `getCountFromServer` does not support distinct counts directly. The most robust way to get a count of unique enrolled users is to:
1.  Fetch all enrollment documents.
2.  Extract the `userId` from each enrollment.
3.  Use a `Set` to get a collection of unique `userId`s.
4.  Get the size of the `Set`.

#### Detailed Steps:

1.  **Add a new helper function `getUniqueEnrolledUserCount` to `src/services/db.js`:**

    ```javascript
    /**
     * Retrieves the count of unique users who have at least one enrollment.
     * @returns {Promise<number>} The number of unique enrolled users.
     */
    export const getUniqueEnrolledUserCount = async () => {
      try {
        const enrollmentsRef = collection(db, "enrollments");
        const querySnapshot = await getDocs(enrollmentsRef);
        const uniqueUserIds = new Set();
        querySnapshot.forEach(doc => {
          uniqueUserIds.add(doc.data().userId);
        });
        return uniqueUserIds.size;
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error fetching unique enrolled user count:", error);
        return 0;
      }
    };
    ```

2.  **Modify `getAdminDashboardStats` in `src/services/db.js` to use this new function:**

    ```javascript
    // Locate the existing getAdminDashboardStats function
    export const getAdminDashboardStats = async () => {
      try {
        // ... (existing code for usersRef, coursesRef, enrollmentsRef, blogPostsRef) ...
        const usersRef = collection(db, "users");
        const coursesRef = collection(db, "courses");
        const enrollmentsRef = collection(db, "enrollments");
        const blogPostsRef = collection(db, "blogPosts");

        // ... (existing code for pendingVerificationQuery) ...
        const pendingVerificationQuery = query(
          enrollmentsRef,
          where("status", "in", [
            "pending_verification",
            "pending_confirmation",
            "awaiting_payment",
          ])
        );

        // Use Promise.all to run all our database queries in parallel for maximum speed.
        const [
          userCountSnap,
          courseCountSnap,
          enrollmentCountSnap,
          pendingEnrollmentCountSnap,
          blogPostCountSnap,
          uniqueEnrolledUserCount, // Add this line
        ] = await Promise.all([
          getCountFromServer(usersRef),
          getCountFromServer(coursesRef),
          getCountFromServer(enrollmentsRef),
          getCountFromServer(pendingVerificationQuery),
          getCountFromServer(blogPostsRef),
          getUniqueEnrolledUserCount(), // Add this line
        ]);

        // Return a clean object with all the data.
        return {
          totalUsers: userCountSnap.data().count,
          totalCourses: courseCountSnap.data().count,
          totalEnrollments: enrollmentCountSnap.data().count,
          pendingEnrollments: pendingEnrollmentCountSnap.data().count,
          totalBlogPosts: blogPostCountSnap.data().count,
          uniqueEnrolledUsers: uniqueEnrolledUserCount, // Add this line
        };
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error fetching admin dashboard stats:", error);
        return {
          totalUsers: 0,
          totalCourses: 0,
          totalEnrollments: 0,
          pendingEnrollments: 0,
          totalBlogPosts: 0,
          uniqueEnrolledUsers: 0, // Add this line
        };
      }
    };
    ```

### Action 2: Modify `src/views/admin/AdminDashboard.vue`

We will add a new stat card to display the `uniqueEnrolledUsers` count.

#### Detailed Steps:

1.  **Locate the `<div class="stats-grid">` section in `src/views/admin/AdminDashboard.vue`.**
2.  **Add a new `stat-card` for "Enrolled Users" within this grid.** You can place it after "Total Users" or "Total Enrollments" as per your preference.

    ```html
    <!-- Enrolled Users Stat Card (New) -->
    <div class="stat-card">
      <div class="stat-card-header">
        <h3 class="stat-title">Enrolled Users</h3>
        <div class="stat-icon icon-enrollments"> <!-- Reusing icon-enrollments for now -->
          <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24">
            <path d="M12 3L1 9l11 6 9-4.91V17h2V9L12 3zm6.82 6L12 12.72 5.18 9 12 5.28 18.82 9zM17 15.99l-5 2.73-5-2.73V12l5 2.73 5-2.73v3.99z"/>
          </svg>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="stat-value">{{ stats.uniqueEnrolledUsers }}</p>
      <RouterLink to="/admin/enrollments" class="stat-link"
        >View Enrollments â†’</RouterLink
      >
    </div>
    ```
    *(Note: You might want to create a new SVG icon for "Enrolled Users" if you prefer a different visual representation.)*

#### Verification:
1.  **Ensure you have at least one user enrolled in a course.**
2.  **Navigate to the Admin Dashboard.**
3.  **Verify that the new "Enrolled Users" card appears** and displays the correct count of unique users who have enrolled.

## Phase 3: Display Enrollment Status in User Management

### Objective
Add a new column to the user management table (`AdminUsers.vue`) that shows the number of courses each user is enrolled in.

### Rationale
This provides administrators with immediate insight into a user's engagement level directly from the user list, without needing to navigate to a separate enrollment page.

### Action 1: Enhance `src/services/db.js` - `getAllUsers` function

We need to modify `getAllUsers` to fetch enrollment data for each user. To do this efficiently, we will:
1.  Fetch all users.
2.  Fetch all enrollments.
3.  Map the enrollments to their respective users to get a count of courses per user.

#### Detailed Steps:

1.  **Modify `getAllUsers` in `src/services/db.js`:**

    ```javascript
    // Locate the existing getAllUsers function
    export const getAllUsers = async () => {
      try {
        const usersRef = collection(db, "users");
        const usersQuery = query(usersRef, orderBy("createdAt", "desc"));
        const usersSnapshot = await getDocs(usersQuery);

        const users = usersSnapshot.docs.map((doc) => ({ id: doc.id, ...doc.data() }));

        // Fetch all enrollments
        const enrollmentsRef = collection(db, "enrollments");
        const enrollmentsSnapshot = await getDocs(enrollmentsRef);
        const userEnrollmentCounts = {};

        // Count enrollments per user
        enrollmentsSnapshot.forEach(doc => {
          const enrollmentData = doc.data();
          const userId = enrollmentData.userId;
          if (userId) {
            userEnrollmentCounts[userId] = (userEnrollmentCounts[userId] || 0) + 1;
          }
        });

        // Attach enrollment count to each user
        return users.map(user => ({
          ...user,
          enrolledCoursesCount: userEnrollmentCounts[user.id] || 0,
        }));

      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error fetching all users with enrollment counts:", error);
        return [];
      }
    };
    ```

### Action 2: Modify `src/views/admin/AdminUsers.vue`

We will add a new table column to display the `enrolledCoursesCount`.

#### Detailed Steps:

1.  **Locate the `<thead>` section in `src/views/admin/AdminUsers.vue`.**
2.  **Add a new `<th>` for "Enrolled Courses" (or similar) after "Joined On":**

    ```html
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Display Name</th>
        <th>Email</th>
        <th>Role</th>
        <th>Joined On</th>
        <th>Enrolled Courses</th> <!-- New column header -->
        <th>Actions</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    ```

3.  **Locate the `<tbody>` section and the `v-for="user in users"` loop.**
4.  **Add a new `<td>` to display `user.enrolledCoursesCount` after the "Joined On" `<td>`:**

    ```html
    <tbody>
      <tr v-for="user in users" :key="user.id">
        <td data-label="Display Name">{{ user.displayName || "N/A" }}</td>
        <td data-label="Email">{{ user.email }}</td>
        <td data-label="Role">
          <span :class="['role-badge', `role-${user.role || 'student'}`]">
            {{ user.role || "student" }}
          </span>
        </td>
        <td data-label="Joined On">{{ formatDate(user.createdAt) }}</td>
        <td data-label="Enrolled Courses">{{ user.enrolledCoursesCount }}</td> <!-- New data cell -->
        <td data-label="Actions" class="actions-cell">
          <button
            @click="handleChangeRole(user)"
            :disabled="user.id === currentUser?.uid"
            class="btn-action btn-role-toggle"
            :title="
              user.id === currentUser?.uid
                ? 'Cannot change your own role'
                : 'Toggle admin role'
            "
          >
            {{ user.role === "admin" ? "Make Student" : "Make Admin" }}
          </button>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
    ```

5.  **Update the media query in the `<style scoped>` section of `AdminUsers.vue`** to ensure the new column is handled gracefully on smaller screens. Add a new `data-label` for "Enrolled Courses".

    ```css
    @media (max-width: 768px) {
      /* ... existing styles ... */
      .users-table td::before {
        content: attr(data-label);
        position: absolute;
        left: 1rem;
        font-weight: var(--font-semibold);
        color: var(--text-secondary-light);
      }
      /* Add this new rule */
      .users-table td[data-label="Enrolled Courses"]::before {
        content: "Enrolled Courses";
      }
    }
    ```

---

## Firebase Security Rules Considerations

### Objective
To ensure that the proposed changes do not introduce any security vulnerabilities or break existing data access patterns defined in Firebase Security Rules.

### Rationale
The current Firebase Security Rules (`src/services/modified.firebaseRules.md`) already include robust `isAdmin()` checks for read and write operations across relevant collections (`users`, `enrollments`). The proposed changes primarily involve enhancing data retrieval and display for admin users, which are already covered by these existing rules.

### Conclusion
**No changes to Firebase Security Rules are required.** The existing rules are sufficient to support the new functionalities for admin users, including:
*   **Phase 1 (Ensuring all authenticated users are in Firestore):** The `allow write: if isOwner(userId) || isAdmin();` rule for the `/users/{userId}` collection permits both creation and updates of user profiles by the owner or an admin.
*   **Phase 2 (Adding "Enrolled Users" count to Dashboard):** The `allow read: if isOwner(resource.data.userId) || isAdmin();` rule for the `/enrollments/{enrollmentId}` collection allows admins to read all enrollment documents to calculate the unique enrolled user count.
*   **Phase 3 (Displaying Enrollment Status in User Management):** The `allow read: if isOwner(userId) || isAdmin();` rule for `/users/{userId}` and the `allow read: if isOwner(resource.data.userId) || isAdmin();` rule for `/enrollments/{enrollmentId}` ensure that admins can fetch all necessary user and enrollment data.

---

## Important Considerations:

*   **Firestore Indexing:** For optimal performance, especially with larger datasets, ensure you have the necessary Firestore indexes. If you encounter "failed-precondition" errors in your browser's developer console, Firebase will usually provide a direct link to create the required composite index.
*   **Performance for Very Large Datasets:**
    *   Fetching *all* users and *all* enrollments to calculate counts in the client-side (`getAllUsers` and `getUniqueEnrolledUserCount`) is efficient for small to medium datasets (hundreds to a few thousand documents).
    *   For very large datasets (tens of thousands or more), this approach might become slow and consume more read operations. In such cases, consider using **Firebase Cloud Functions** to:
        *   Maintain aggregated counts (e.g., total users, total enrolled users) in a separate document that is updated automatically on user creation/deletion or enrollment changes.
        *   Perform server-side joins or aggregations for the `getAllUsers` function to reduce client-side processing.
*   **Error Handling:** The provided code includes basic error logging. Ensure your application's global error handling (e.g., Vue's `errorHandler`) is robust.

This plan provides a detailed roadmap for implementing the requested features. Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring a logical and verifiable progression.
