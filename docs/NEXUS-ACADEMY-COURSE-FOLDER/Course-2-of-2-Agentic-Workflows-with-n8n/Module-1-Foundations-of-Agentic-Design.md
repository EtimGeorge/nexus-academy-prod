Of course. We will now proceed with the curriculum development for our second, more advanced course.

I have performed extensive research using my browsing capabilities to synthesize the most relevant, up-to-date, and practical information for this technically focused course. The modules and lessons are structured to guide a student from foundational concepts to building a complex, multi-step AI agent, ensuring a deep and practical acquisition of skills.

### **Course 2 of 2: Agentic Workflows with n8n**

This is the complete, expanded, and production-ready curriculum content for our "builder-focused" course.

### **Module 1: Foundations of Agentic Design**

This module establishes the core mental models for the entire course. It moves beyond simple "prompt-and-response" and teaches the student to think in terms of systems, tools, and autonomous processes. It is the essential foundation for building true AI agents.

    <h2>Moving Beyond the Chat Box</h2>
    <p>In our last course, we mastered the art of the prompt. We learned how to have a sophisticated conversation with an AI. An AI Agent, however, is not about conversation; it's about **action**. In this lesson, we'll define what truly separates a simple prompt from a powerful, autonomous agent.</p>
    
    <h3>The Limitations of a Prompt</h3>
    <p>A standard interaction with an LLM is a closed loop: you provide a prompt, it provides a response, and the interaction ends. The AI has no memory of past conversations and no ability to interact with the outside world. It is a brilliant but isolated brain in a jar.</p>

    <h3>The Anatomy of an Agent</h3>
    <p>An AI Agent is a system that breaks out of this jar. It's a system that can not only "think" (using an LLM) but can also **perceive, remember, and act**. An agent operates in a continuous loop:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Observe:</strong> It takes in new information or a new goal.</li>
      <li><strong>Think:</strong> It uses an LLM to reason about the observation, break down the goal into steps, and decide on the next action.</li>
      <li><strong>Act:</strong> It executes an action by using a "tool" (e.g., performing a web search, accessing an API, sending an email).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This loop repeats until the final goal is accomplished. An agent is a system that can **autonomously** pursue a complex objective. In this course, we will learn how to build the brain and nervous system for these agents.</p>

    <h2>The Trinity of Agentic Systems</h2>
    <p>Every AI agent, from the simplest to the most complex, is built from three fundamental components. Understanding these components is the key to designing effective and powerful workflows.</p>

    <h3>1. The LLM: The "Brain" or "Reasoning Engine"</h3>
    <p>This is the core of our agent. The Large Language Model (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 3) is responsible for all the "thinking." Its job is not just to answer questions, but to function as a decision-making engine. We will give it a goal and a set of available tools, and its primary task will be to reason about the problem and decide which tool to use next to get closer to the goal.</p>
    
    <h3>2. Tools: The "Hands and Senses"</h3>
    <p>Tools are what give our agent the ability to interact with the world outside of its own context. A tool is any function or service the agent can call to get new information or perform an action. Common tools include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Web Search:</strong> To get up-to-date information.</li>
      <li><strong>API Calls:</strong> To interact with other software (e.g., check the weather, post to social media, search a database).</li>
      <li><strong>Code Execution:</strong> To perform complex calculations or manipulate data.</li>
      <li><strong>Human Input:</strong> To ask clarifying questions when it gets stuck.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Memory: The "Notebook"</h3>
    <p>An LLM's built-in memory is limited to the current conversation. For an agent to perform multi-step tasks, it needs a way to remember what it has done and what it has learned. We will explore two types of memory:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Short-Term Memory (The "Scratchpad"):</strong> A temporary place to store the history of the current task.</li>
      <li><strong>Long-Term Memory (The "Library"):</strong> A permanent, searchable database (often a vector database) where the agent can store and retrieve key information and past experiences.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Throughout this course, we will learn how to wire these three components together to create sophisticated, autonomous systems.</p>
    ```

*   **Secure Video URL:** `(placeholder)`

    <h2>Building Without Barriers</h2>
    <p>Building AI agents can seem complex, but modern tools have made it incredibly accessible. In this course, our primary "workshop" will be n8n (pronounced "n-eight-n"). In this lesson, you'll learn what n8n is and why it's the perfect platform for visual agentic design.</p>
    
    <h3>What is n8n?</h3>
    <p>n8n is an open-source, node-based workflow automation tool. Think of it like a digital LEGO set for building automations. Instead of writing code, you connect different "nodes" on a visual canvas. Each node represents a specific action or service.</p>
    
    <h3>Why n8n is Perfect for Agentic Workflows</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Visual First:</strong> You can see the entire flow of your agent's logic at a glance. This makes it incredibly easy to design, debug, and understand complex, multi-step processes.</li>
      <li><strong>Extensive Integrations:</strong> n8n has hundreds of pre-built nodes for almost every major service and API, from Google Sheets and Slack to OpenAI and Anthropic. This gives our agents a massive library of "tools" right out of the box.</li>
      <li><strong>Logic and Branching:</strong> It has built-in nodes for handling complex logic, like "IF" statements, loops, and data transformations, which are essential for agentic decision-making.</li>
      <li><strong>Self-Hostable & Scalable:</strong> You can run n8n on your own server for complete control and data privacy, and it's built to handle enterprise-level workloads.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Setting Up Your n8n Cloud Account</h3>
    <p>For this course, we will be using the n8n Cloud version, which is the easiest way to get started. In this lesson, we will walk you through the step-by-step process of signing up for a free n8n Cloud account and creating your first empty workflow. This visual canvas will be where all of our agentic systems come to life.</p>
    ```

**Lesson 1.4**
*   **Lesson Title:** Setting Up Secure Connections and Credentials
*   **Secure Video URL:** `(placeholder)`
*   **Estimated Duration:** `10 minutes`
*   **Has Playground?** `false`
*   **Lesson Content (HTML):**

    <h2>The Keys to the Kingdom: Managing API Keys</h2>
    <p>For our agents to use tools like OpenAI, Google Search, or any other API, they need to authenticate themselves using secret API keys. Managing these keys securely is the most important part of building a safe and robust automation. In this lesson, you'll learn the correct, professional way to manage credentials in n8n.</p>
    
    <h3>Why You NEVER Hardcode Keys</h3>
    <p>You should never, ever paste a secret API key directly into a node or a code block. This is a massive security risk. If you ever share your workflow, the key will be exposed. n8n has a dedicated, encrypted system for managing credentials.</p>

    <h3>Creating Your First Credential in n8n</h3>
    <p>We will walk through the process of creating your first, essential credential: OpenAI.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Get your API Key:</strong> We'll show you where to find your secret API key on the OpenAI platform dashboard.</li>
      <li><strong>Navigate to the Credentials section in n8n:</strong> Find the dedicated, secure area for storing keys.</li>
      <li><strong>Create a new "OpenAI API" credential:</strong> Select the correct credential type from n8n's list.</li>
      <li><strong>Paste and Save:</strong> Paste your secret key into the credential field and save it. n8n will encrypt and store this key securely.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>From now on, whenever you use an OpenAI node in any of your workflows, you will simply select this named credential from a dropdown menu. n8n handles the rest in the background. This process keeps your keys safe, and allows you to easily update a key in one place if it ever changes. We will follow this exact process for every new service we connect to in this course.</p>
