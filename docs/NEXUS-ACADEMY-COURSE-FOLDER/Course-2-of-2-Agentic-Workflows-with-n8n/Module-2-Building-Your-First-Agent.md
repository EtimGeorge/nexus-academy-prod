Of course. We will now proceed with the curriculum development for Module 2.

I have performed extensive research using my browsing capabilities to synthesize the most relevant and practical information for this hands-on module. The lessons are structured as a direct, project-based workflow, guiding the student from a theoretical framework to the practical construction of their first functional AI agent.

### **Module 2: Building Your First Agent**

This module is where the theory ends and the building begins. Students will construct a complete, multi-step agent from scratch. They will learn how to make an LLM use external tools to solve a problem that it could not solve on its own. This module is designed to deliver the first major "aha!" moment of the course.

**(Action: In your Admin Panel, go to the Course Editor for "Agentic Workflows with n8n", and add a new module titled "Building Your First Agent". Then, add the four lessons below to this module.)**

    <h2>Teaching the AI to "Show Its Work"</h2>
    <p>How do we get an LLM to not just give us an answer, but to reason about a problem and decide to use a tool? The answer is a powerful prompting framework called **ReAct**, which stands for **Reason + Act**. This is the foundational logic that powers most modern AI agents.</p>
    
    <h3>The ReAct Loop</h3>
    <p>Instead of asking the AI for a final answer, we teach it to operate in a loop, thinking step-by-step and outputting its thoughts in a structured way. For each step, the AI generates a response that contains three parts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Thought:</strong> The AI's internal monologue. It analyzes the current situation, reflects on the overall goal, and decides what it needs to do next.</li>
      <li><strong>Action:</strong> The specific tool the AI decides to use (e.g., `web_search`) and the input for that tool (e.g., `latest AI news`).</li>
      <li><strong>Observation:</strong> This is where we, the workflow, will paste the *result* from the tool after we run it.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>The Master ReAct Prompt</h3>
    <p>We enable this behavior with a carefully crafted system prompt. This prompt gives the AI its goal, a list of available tools, and strict instructions on how to format its response. It's the "operating system" for our agent.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <strong>System Prompt Example:</strong><br>
      "You are a helpful research assistant. Your goal is to answer the user's question.<br><br>
      You have access to the following tools:<br>
      - **web_search[query]:** Use this to search the web for up-to-date information.<br>
      - **finish[answer]:** Use this tool ONLY when you have enough information to provide a final answer.<br><br>
      To use a tool, you MUST format your response as a JSON object with 'thought' and 'action' keys. The 'action' key must contain 'tool_name' and 'tool_input'.<br><br>
      After I use a tool for you, I will return the result as an 'Observation'. You will then continue the process until you can use the 'finish' tool."
    </blockquote>
    <p>In the following lessons, we will build a workflow in n8n that implements this exact loop, allowing our LLM to call tools and achieve complex goals.</p>
    ```

    <h2>Breaking Out of the Knowledge Box</h2>
    <p>An LLM's knowledge is frozen in time. To answer questions about current events, it needs a tool to access the live internet. In this lesson, we will build the core of our agent in n8n and give it its first and most important tool: **Web Search**.</p>
    
    <h3>Building the n8n "Tool Router"</h3>
    <p>Our n8n workflow will be the system that executes the actions chosen by the LLM. The core of this is a "Switch" node, which acts as a tool router.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The LLM outputs a JSON object like `{ "action": { "tool_name": "web_search", "tool_input": "latest AI news" } }`.</li>
      <li>We extract the `tool_name`, which is "web_search".</li>
      <li>The n8n Switch node receives this name. It has different output paths for each possible tool. If the input is "web_search", it sends the data down the web search path.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Integrating a Search API</h3>
    <p>To perform a web search, we need a search provider. We will be using a service like **Serper API** or **Google Search API**. In this lesson, we will walk through:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Signing up for a free API key from a search provider.</li>
      <li>Creating a new, secure credential in n8n for this service.</li>
      <li>Adding an "HTTP Request" node to our workflow on the "web_search" path.</li>
      <li>Configuring this node to take the `tool_input` from the LLM and send it to the search API.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By the end of this lesson, you will have a functional workflow where your AI can decide it needs to search the web, and your n8n workflow will automatically perform that search on its behalf.</p>
    ```

**Lesson 2.3**
*   **Lesson Title:** The "Scratchpad": Implementing Short-Term Memory
*   **Secure Video URL:** `(placeholder)`
*   **Estimated Duration:** `20 minutes`
*   **Has Playground?** `false` (n8n Workflow Practical)
*   **Lesson Content (HTML):**
    ```html
    <h2>Remembering the Conversation</h2>
    <p>For our agent to perform a multi-step task, it needs to remember the results of its previous actions. If it performs a web search, it must remember the answer it found to inform its next thought. We achieve this with a "scratchpad," which is a simple but powerful form of short-term memory.</p>

    <h3>The Concept of a Chat History</h3>
    <p>The scratchpad is essentially a running transcript of the agent's entire thought process. Before we call the LLM for the *next* step, we assemble a history of everything that has happened so far.</p>
    
    <h3>Building the Loop in n8n</h3>
    <p>Our n8n workflow will now become a true loop. We will use a "Merge" node and a "Function" node to build this memory.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <strong>The Workflow Loop:</strong><br>
      1. **Start:** The user asks a question.<br>
      2. **LLM Call:** We send the question and the ReAct prompt to the LLM.<br>
      3. **Tool Routing:** The AI outputs an action (e.g., `web_search`). We use our Switch node to execute it.<br>
      4. **Get Observation:** We get the result from the tool (e.g., the search results).<br>
      5. **Build Memory:** We use a Function node to append the AI's last thought and the new observation to our "chat history" variable.<br>
      6. **Loop Back:** We send this entire, updated chat history back to the LLM in the next call. The AI can now see its previous thoughts and the results, allowing it to reason about the next step.<br>
      7. **Repeat:** This process repeats until the AI decides to use the `finish` action.
    </blockquote>
    <p>In this lesson, you will modify your n8n workflow to include this memory-building loop, transforming it from a one-shot tool user into a persistent, reasoning agent.</p>
    ```

*   **Secure Video URL:** `(placeholder)`

    <h2>Putting It All Together: Your First Autonomous Agent</h2>
    <p>It's time to combine everything we've learned in this module into a single, functional project. You will build a complete Research Agent that can take a complex question, autonomously search the web to gather information, and then synthesize that information into a final, coherent answer.</p>
    
    <h3>The Project Brief</h3>
    <p>Your goal is to build an n8n workflow that can successfully answer the following question: **"Who won the most recent F1 Grand Prix, and what were the key moments of the race?"**</p>
    <p>An LLM cannot answer this on its own because the information is too recent. Your agent must use its tools to succeed.</p>

    <h3>Your Agent's Required Abilities (The Checklist)</h3>
    <p>Your final workflow must successfully demonstrate the following loop:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Initial Thought:</strong> The agent should reason that it does not know the answer and its first action must be to search the web for "most recent F1 Grand Prix results".</li>
      <li><strong>First Observation:</strong> Your n8n workflow must execute the search and feed the results back into the agent's memory.</li>
      <li><strong>Second Thought:</strong> After seeing the results, the agent should reason about the next step. It might decide it needs more details and perform a second search, such as "key moments of the [Race Name] Grand Prix".</li>
      <li><strong>Second Observation:</strong> Your workflow must execute this second search.</li>
      <li><strong>Final Thought & Action:</strong> After gathering sufficient information from its searches, the agent must reason that it has enough data and decide to use the `finish` tool, providing a synthesized, well-written answer in its own words.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>By completing this project, you will have built a true AI agent that demonstrates reasoning, tool use, and memory. This is the foundational skill for all advanced agentic design, and it will be the basis for the more complex systems we will build in the next module.</p>
