    <h2>The Next Frontier: Bringing Your Ideas to Life</h2>
    <p>If generative images were the revolution of last year, generative video is the revolution of today. The technology is moving at an incredible pace. In this lesson, you'll get a high-level overview of the major players and learn the fundamental prompting techniques for creating short video clips from text.</p>
    
    <h3>The Key Players: A Quick Guide</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>OpenAI's Sora:</strong> The most powerful and realistic model, known for its incredible coherence and length. Currently in limited access, but its technology sets the standard.</li>
      <li><strong>Runway Gen-2:</strong> One of the first and most widely available high-quality video models. Excellent for creating short, cinematic clips and integrated into a full video editing suite.</li>
      <li><strong>Pika Labs:</strong> A strong competitor to Runway, known for its vibrant and artistic styles. Very popular for creating animated content and music videos.</li>
      <li><strong>Kuaishou's Kling:</strong> A new, powerful model from China that is challenging Sora in terms of quality and realism, capable of generating longer, high-fidelity clips.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Prompting for Motion: Text-to-Video</h3>
    <p>Prompting for video is an extension of image prompting, but with one key new ingredient: **describing motion**. You need to tell the AI not just what to create, but what it should *do*.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <strong>Example Prompt Structure:</strong><br>
      "[Subject & Scene], [Style & Medium], [Lighting & Atmosphere], [Composition & Framing], <strong>[Description of Motion]</strong>."<br><br>
      <strong>Example Prompt:</strong><br>
      "A photorealistic golden retriever puppy <strong>running through a field of tall grass in slow motion</strong>. Cinematic film still, golden hour lighting. --ar 16:9"
    </blockquote>
    <p>The key is to use active, descriptive verbs. In the playground for this lesson, we will use a text-to-video tool like Runway to practice creating your first simple video clips from a text prompt.</p>
    ```

**Lesson 4.2**
*   **Lesson Title:** Image-to-Video and Video-to-Video Techniques
*   **Secure Video URL:** `(placeholder)`
*   **Estimated Duration:** `12 minutes`

    <h2>Animating the Static World</h2>
    <p>Beyond creating video from scratch, AI models can "animate" existing images or transform the style of existing videos. These techniques are incredibly powerful for content marketing.</p>
    
    <h3>Image-to-Video: Bringing Your Midjourney Creations to Life</h3>
    <p>This is one of the most exciting workflows. You can take a stunning, high-quality image that you perfected in Midjourney and use it as a starting point for a video.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Upload your Midjourney image to a tool like Runway or Pika Labs.</li>
        <li>Provide an optional text prompt to describe the motion you want to see (e.g., "The clouds drift slowly across the sky").</li>
        <li>The AI will generate a short video clip that maintains the style, composition, and subject of your original image while adding subtle, realistic motion.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This is the perfect way to turn static social media posts into eye-catching, dynamic videos.</p>

    <h3>Video-to-Video: The Ultimate Style Transfer</h3>
    <p>This technique allows you to apply a completely new artistic style to an existing video clip. You can upload a simple video shot on your phone and transform it into a claymation animation, a cyberpunk scene, or a watercolor painting.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <strong>Workflow:</strong><br>
      1. Upload your source video clip.<br>
      2. Provide a text prompt describing the desired **target style** (e.g., "A gritty, black and white film noir movie").<br>
      3. The AI will re-render your video, preserving the motion and composition but completely changing the visual style to match your prompt.
    </blockquote>
    <p>In the playground, you will take an image you created in Module 3 and use the image-to-video technique to animate it.</p>
    ```

**Lesson 4.3**
*   **Lesson Title:** AI Voice Cloning & Custom Avatars
*   **Secure Video URL:** `(placeholder)`
*   **Estimated Duration:** `18 minutes`
*   **Has Playground?** `false` (This is a conceptual and tool-based lesson)

    <h2>Creating Your Digital Persona</h2>
    <p>The final layer of multimedia creation is audio and presentation. Modern AI tools allow you to create incredibly realistic voiceovers and even digital avatars of yourself, opening up new possibilities for creating scalable video content without ever stepping in front of a camera.</p>

    <h3>AI Voice Generation & Cloning</h3>
    <p>Tools like ElevenLabs and Play.ht offer two amazing capabilities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Text-to-Speech:</strong> You can choose from a library of hundreds of hyper-realistic AI voices to generate a professional voiceover from a simple text script. You can control the pacing, emotion, and tone.</li>
      <li><strong>Voice Cloning:</strong> This is the next level. By providing just a few minutes of your own recorded speech, these platforms can create a digital replica of your voice. You can then use this "voice clone" to generate new audio in your own voice simply by typing text. This is a game-changer for creating podcasts, course narration, and video voiceovers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Ethical Note:</strong> It is a violation of the terms of service of all major platforms, and a serious ethical breach, to clone someone's voice without their explicit, enthusiastic consent.</p>

    <h3>AI Avatars with HeyGen</h3>
    <p>HeyGen is the leading platform for creating AI-powered video presenters. You can either use their library of stock avatars or, for a more professional touch, create a digital avatar of yourself. The process involves recording a short video of yourself speaking. The platform then creates a digital puppet that can be animated to speak any text you provide, using a voice you select (including your own voice clone). This allows you to create professional-quality "talking head" videos for marketing or training at scale, without the need for a camera, microphone, or studio setup for every new video.</p>
    ```

*   **Lesson Title:** Capstone Project: Launch a Full AI-Generated Ad Campaign
*   **Secure Video URL:** `(placeholder)`

    <h2>Your Final Project: From Concept to Campaign</h2>
    <p>It's time to put everything you've learned together. In this final capstone lesson, you will execute a complete, end-to-end workflow to create all the assets for a fictional marketing campaign. This project will be the centerpiece of your new AI content creation portfolio.</p>
    
    <h3>The Project Brief</h3>
    <p>Your task is to create a social media ad campaign for a fictional product: a new, eco-friendly coffee brand called "Aura Beans".</p>
    
    <h3>Your Required Assets (The Checklist)</h3>
    <p>You will use the AI tools and techniques from this course to create the following:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Ad Copy (Lesson 2.2 & 2.3):</strong> Write three variations of a short, punchy ad copy for an Instagram post using the PAS framework and then refining it with your own voice.</li>
      <li><strong>Visual Asset (Module 3):</strong> Using Midjourney, create a stunning, high-quality image that represents the "Aura Beans" brand. Use the 4 Pillars of prompting and refine the image with Vary (Region) or Pan/Zoom to get a perfect result.</li>
      <li><strong>Video Ad (Lesson 4.2):</strong> Take your final image from Midjourney and use the Image-to-Video technique in Runway or Pika to create a short, 4-second animated video ad.</li>
      <li><strong>Voiceover Script (Lesson 2.2):</strong> Write a short, 15-second voiceover script for the video ad.</li>
      <li><strong>Audio Voiceover (Lesson 4.3):</strong> Use a tool like ElevenLabs to generate a professional audio voiceover from your script.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Submission & Completion</h3>
    <p>To complete this course, you will submit a link to a folder containing all five of these assets. This project proves that you have not just learned the theory but have successfully mastered the practical, hands-on skills of an AI-powered content creator.</p>
    <p>Congratulations on completing the AI for Content & Marketing Masterclass! You are now at the forefront of the new creative revolution.</p>
