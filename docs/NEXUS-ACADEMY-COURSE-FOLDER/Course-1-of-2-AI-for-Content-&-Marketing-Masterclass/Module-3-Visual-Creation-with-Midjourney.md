Of course. We will now proceed with the curriculum development for Module 3.

I have performed extensive research using my browsing capabilities to synthesize the most relevant, up-to-date, and practical information for this visually-focused and highly creative module. The lessons are structured to take a student from understanding the fundamentals of a Midjourney prompt to executing a complete, professional workflow.

    <h2>Painting with Words: The Art of Visual Prompting</h2>
    <p>Creating images with Midjourney is like speaking a new language. The structure of your prompt directly controls the quality and style of your output. In this lesson, you'll learn the 4 essential pillars of a professional-grade Midjourney prompt.</p>
    
    <h3>The 4 Pillars of a Master Prompt</h3>
    <p>A great visual prompt is a recipe with four key ingredients:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Subject & Scene:</strong> This is the core of your image. Be descriptive. What is the main focus? What is happening? What is the environment? (e.g., "An astronaut drinking coffee on a futuristic Mars balcony").</li>
      <li><strong>Style & Medium:</strong> How should the image look? Is it a photograph, a watercolor painting, a 3D render, or a comic book illustration? (e.g., "cinematic film still, 35mm photograph").</li>
      <li><strong>Lighting & Atmosphere:</strong> This is what creates the mood. Is the lighting dramatic, soft, or neon? Is the atmosphere mysterious, cheerful, or epic? (e.g., "dramatic volumetric lighting, morning golden hour").</li>
      <li><strong>Composition & Framing:</strong> How is the shot framed? Is it a close-up, a wide shot, or a bird's-eye view? This controls how the viewer sees the scene. (e.g., "ultra wide angle shot, from a low angle").</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Example Breakdown & Midjourney Parameters</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <strong>Simple Prompt:</strong> "a robot"<br>
      <strong>Master Prompt:</strong> "<strong>(Subject)</strong> A photorealistic chrome robot holding a glowing blue orb, standing in a rainy neon-lit cyberpunk city street. <strong>(Style)</strong> Cinematic film still, sharp focus, high detail. <strong>(Lighting)</strong> Moody, dramatic cinematic lighting with reflections on the wet pavement. <strong>(Composition)</strong> Full body shot, from a low angle. <strong>--ar 16:9 --v 6.0 --style raw</strong>"
    </blockquote>
    <p>The ` -- ` at the end are **parameters**. They are technical commands that control the AI. ` --ar 16:9 ` sets the aspect ratio, ` --v 6.0 ` uses the latest version of the model, and ` --style raw ` gives a more photographic, less "opinionated" look. In the playground, you will experiment with combining these 4 pillars and parameters to create your first stunning images.</p>

    <h2>Beyond One-Off Images: Building a Cohesive Brand</h2>
    <p>A major challenge in AI image generation is consistency. How do you create the same character or style across multiple images? In this lesson, you'll learn two powerful techniques to achieve this, which is essential for creating professional branding assets.</p>
    
    <h3>Technique 1: The "Seed" Parameter</h3>
    <p>Every image grid in Midjourney has a "seed" number, which is the starting point of its random noise. By reusing the same seed number, you can create images with a very similar style and composition.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Generate an image you like.</li>
        <li>React to the result with the "envelope" emoji (‚úâÔ∏è).</li>
        <li>The Midjourney Bot will send you a direct message with the job details, including the `--seed` number.</li>
        <li>Now, you can use this seed in a new prompt to influence the result: "A close-up shot of the same character --seed 12345678"</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Technique 2: Character Referencing (The "cref" Parameter)</h3>
    <p>This is the most powerful feature for character consistency. It allows you to use an existing image of a character as a reference.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <strong>Prompt Structure:</strong><br>
      "[Your new prompt, e.g., 'The same character walking through a forest'] <strong>--cref [URL of your reference image]</strong>"
    </blockquote>
    <p>You can even control the "weight" of the reference from 0 to 100 with the `--cw` parameter. ` --cw 100 ` will try to copy the face, hair, and clothes, while ` --cw 0 ` will only copy the face. This is the key to creating a brand mascot or character that can be used in multiple scenes and marketing materials. In the playground, you will practice using both `--seed` and `--cref` to create a series of consistent images.</p>
    ```

    <h2>Editing and Expanding Your Creations</h2>
    <p>Your first generation is rarely the final product. Midjourney provides a suite of powerful tools to edit, expand, and perfect your images directly within Discord. In this lesson, you'll learn how to use the three most important post-generation tools.</p>

    <h3>Pan Buttons (‚¨ÖÔ∏è ‚û°Ô∏è ‚¨ÜÔ∏è ‚¨áÔ∏è)</h3>
    <p>After you upscale an image, you'll see pan arrows. Clicking these will expand the canvas in that direction, using the content of the existing image to "imagine" what comes next. This is perfect for turning a close-up shot into a wide landscape or creating a wider banner for a website header.</p>

    <h3>Zoom Out (üîé Zoom Out 2x / 1.5x)</h3>
    <p>The zoom out feature works similarly to panning, but it expands the canvas in all directions simultaneously. It keeps your original subject at the center and builds a larger scene around it. This is a fantastic way to add more context and environment to a character or object you've generated.</p>
    
    <h3>Vary (Region)</h3>
    <p>This is Midjourney's version of "inpainting" and is incredibly powerful for fixing mistakes or changing details. After upscaling an image, click the "Vary (Region)" button. You'll be presented with an editor where you can select a specific part of the image (like a character's hand or an object they are holding). You can then change your prompt to describe what you want in that selected area (e.g., "holding a red apple") and Midjourney will regenerate only that part, leaving the rest of the image untouched. This is the key to achieving a perfect final result.</p>
    ```

    <h2>Putting It All Together</h2>
    <p>In this lesson, we'll walk through a complete, professional workflow, combining all the techniques we've learned to take an idea from a simple concept to a finished piece of marketing material.</p>
    
    <h3>The 5-Step Workflow</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>1. Ideation & Prompt Crafting:</strong> Start by using the 4 Pillars (Subject, Style, Lighting, Composition) to craft a detailed "master prompt" for the core visual you need. Iterate a few times until you get a result you're happy with.</li>
      <li><strong>2. Upscale & Select:</strong> Choose the best image from your initial grid and upscale it to a higher resolution.</li>
      <li><strong>3. Refine with Vary (Region):</strong> Analyze the upscaled image. Are there any small errors or details you want to change? Use the "Vary (Region)" tool to select those areas and regenerate them until they are perfect.</li>
      <li><strong>4. Expand with Pan & Zoom:</strong> Do you need more space for text or a different aspect ratio? Use the Pan and Zoom tools to expand the canvas and create the perfect composition for your final use case (e.g., a wide banner for a Facebook ad).</li>
      <li><strong>5. Final Touches (External):</strong> Download your finished image and bring it into an external tool like Canva or Photoshop. Here you can add your final branding, ad copy, and call-to-action buttons to create the finished ad creative.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>By following this structured workflow, you can reliably and efficiently produce high-quality, professional-grade visual assets for any marketing campaign, moving far beyond what's possible with simple, one-shot prompts.</p>
