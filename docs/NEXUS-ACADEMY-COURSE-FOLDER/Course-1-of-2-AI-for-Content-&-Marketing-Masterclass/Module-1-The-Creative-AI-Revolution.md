Thank you. I have received the `courseData.js` file. It is the perfect starting point. I also acknowledge your approval of my proposed enhancements to our data model. This is a critical step that will significantly increase the value of our courses.

As per your directive, I will now begin the curriculum development process. I will develop each course fully, one module at a time, providing the content in a "copy-paste" format that aligns with our enhanced data model.

I have performed extensive research using my browsing capabilities to synthesize the most relevant, up-to-date, and practical information for our first course.

    <h2>Welcome to the New Creative Age</h2>
    <p>In this foundational lesson, we're going to demystify the "magic" behind modern AI. You'll learn the core difference between the two main types of models that power everything we'll do in this course: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Diffusion Models.</p>
    
    <h3>What are Large Language Models (LLMs)?</h3>
    <p>Think of an LLM like ChatGPT or Claude as a super-powered text predictor. It has been trained on a vast amount of the internet's text and has learned the patterns, relationships, and nuances of human language. Its primary job is to predict the next most likely word in a sequence. While this sounds simple, it's what allows it to write essays, answer questions, and summarize text with incredible fluency.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Core Function:</strong> Text generation, summarization, translation, Q&A.</li>
      <li><strong>How it "Thinks":</strong> By predicting the most probable sequence of words.</li>
      <li><strong>Examples we'll use:</strong> GPT-4, Claude 3.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What are Diffusion Models?</h3>
    <p>Diffusion Models are the power behind AI image generators like Midjourney. The process is fascinating: the model starts with a field of pure random noise (like TV static). It has been trained to recognize objects and concepts within noisy images. Step-by-step, it "denoises" the image, slowly forming it into a coherent picture that matches the text prompt you provided. It's like a sculptor starting with a block of marble and chipping away until a statue emerges.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Core Function:</strong> Image generation from text prompts.</li>
      <li><strong>How it "Thinks":</strong> By progressively removing noise to match a concept.</li>
      <li><strong>Examples we'll use:</strong> Midjourney, DALL-E 3.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Understanding this fundamental difference is key. When you prompt for text, you're guiding a master linguist. When you prompt for an image, you're describing a final sculpture to an artist who starts with a block of static.</p>
    ```

**Lesson 1.2**
*   **Lesson Title:** The Art of the Prompt: Core Principles
*   **Secure Video URL:** `(placeholder)`
*   **Estimated Duration:** `18 minutes`
*   **Has Playground?** `true`
*   **Lesson Content (HTML):**
    ```html
    <h2>Your Instructions are Everything</h2>
    <p>A prompt is not a search query; it's a detailed set of instructions for your AI assistant. The quality of your output is directly tied to the quality of your input. In this lesson, we'll cover the four essential pillars of a "golden" prompt.</p>

    <h3>The CRPA Framework</h3>
    <p>A simple way to remember the core components is CRPA:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>C - Context:</strong> Provide the background information. Who is the audience? What is the situation? The more context the AI has, the better its response will be.</li>
      <li><strong>R - Role:</strong> Tell the AI who it should be. Is it a world-class marketing expert? A skeptical pirate? A friendly, encouraging tutor? Assigning a role is the fastest way to shape the tone and style of the output.</li>
      <li><strong>P - Purpose:</strong> What is the exact goal of this output? Are you trying to write a blog post, generate a list of ideas, or create a social media ad? Be explicit about the final product you want.</li>
      <li><strong>A - Action/Format:</strong> How should the output be formatted? Do you want a bulleted list? A JSON object? A 500-word blog post in Markdown? Specify the exact structure.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Example Breakdown</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <strong>Weak Prompt:</strong> "Write about AI in marketing."<br>
      <strong>Golden Prompt:</strong> "<strong>(R)</strong> As a world-class digital marketing strategist, <strong>(P)</strong> write a 500-word blog post outline <strong>(A)</strong> in Markdown format. <strong>(C)</strong> The target audience is small business owners who are skeptical about new technology. The goal is to demystify AI and highlight 3 low-cost ways they can start using it today."
    </blockquote>
    <p>Notice the difference? The weak prompt gives you a generic, unhelpful essay. The golden prompt gives you a targeted, structured, and immediately useful piece of content. We will practice this framework in the playground below.</p>
    ```

    <h2>Building Your Digital Workshop</h2>
    <p>The AI landscape is vast, but you only need a few key tools to accomplish 95% of all creative and marketing tasks. In this lesson, we'll get you set up with the essential accounts you'll need for this course.</p>
    
    <h3>The "Big Two" for Text</h3>
    <p>You need access to at least one state-of-the-art Large Language Model. We highly recommend having accounts for both, as they have different strengths.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>OpenAI's ChatGPT (GPT-4):</strong> The industry standard. We will be using the paid "Plus" subscription in this course to access the most powerful models and features. Go to chat.openai.com to sign up.</li>
      <li><strong>Anthropic's Claude 3:</strong> A powerful competitor known for its large context window (great for analyzing long documents) and nuanced, creative writing style. Go to claude.ai to sign up.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Gold Standard for Images</h3>
    <p>While there are many image generators, one stands far above the rest for quality, control, and professional output.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Midjourney:</strong> This is the premier AI image generator. It operates through the social platform Discord. We will walk you through the entire setup process, from creating a Discord account to joining the Midjourney server and subscribing to a plan.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Your Video & Audio Toolkit</h3>
    <p>We will introduce these tools in more detail later, but it's a good idea to create free accounts now.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>RunwayML:</strong> A powerful, web-based AI video editor and generator.</li>
      <li><strong>HeyGen:</strong> The leading platform for creating AI avatars and voice clones.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the next lesson, we will discuss the important ethical guidelines to keep in mind as you start creating with these powerful tools.</p>
    ```

    <h2>With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility</h2>
    <p>Generative AI is an incredible tool, but it's essential to use it ethically and responsibly. In this lesson, we'll cover the key principles that will guide our work at Nexus Academy and in your professional career.</p>
    
    <h3>1. Transparency and Disclosure</h3>
    <p>Always be transparent about the use of AI. If a blog post was co-written with an AI, or if an image is AI-generated, it's best practice to disclose it. This builds trust with your audience and avoids any claims of deception. Many platforms are now requiring this disclosure.</p>
    
    <h3>2. Copyright and Originality</h3>
    <p>The legal landscape around AI and copyright is still evolving. The general rule is this: AI models are trained on existing data, but the final output you create through your unique prompt is a new work. However, you should never use AI to directly plagiarize or impersonate the specific style of a living artist without permission. Use AI to create *new* things, not to copy existing ones.</p>

    <h3>3. Bias and Fact-Checking</h3>
    <p>AI models learn from the internet, which is full of biases and misinformation. LLMs can "hallucinate" and confidently state incorrect facts. **You are the final editor.** Never blindly copy and paste AI-generated content without fact-checking critical information and reviewing it for potential biases.</p>

    <h3>4. The "Co-Pilot" Mentality</h3>
    <p>The most important principle is to view AI as a co-pilot, not an autopilot. It is a tool to augment your creativity, speed up your workflow, and overcome creative blocks. It is not a replacement for human skill, judgment, or creativity. The final product is always your responsibility.</p>
