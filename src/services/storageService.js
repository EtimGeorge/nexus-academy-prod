// /src/services/storageService.js - MIGRATED TO VUE PROJECT

// This service is an abstraction layer for our file storage.
// Currently, it uses a placeholder to simulate file uploads. This is a best practice
// that allows us to build the UI and logic of our application independently of the
// final backend storage implementation. When we are ready to use Firebase Storage,
// we will only need to change this one file, and the rest of the app will work seamlessly.

 *
 * @param {string} userId - The ID of the user uploading the image.
 * @param {File} file - The image file object to be "uploaded".
 * @returns {Promise<string>} A promise that resolves with the URL of the "uploaded" image.

  // in the UI feel realistic.

  // in Firebase Auth and Firestore) to work correctly with a valid image URL.
